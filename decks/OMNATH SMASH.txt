lands
1 Blighted Woodland #generates colorless until titania and / or omnath are on the battlefield. maybe even turn it into creature first, to trigger both of omnath  abilities
1 Cinder Glade #fetchable with any non-basic forest ramp spell
1 Drownyard Temple #returns itself from graveyard for more landfall triggers, sacrifice shenanigans

ramp

1 Budoka Gardener #land from hand into play. later create giant elementals
1 Farseek #searches library, can find any mountain card, for example shock dual
1 Fertilid #up to two basics, more if additional counters can be added to it
1 Frontier Guide #repeatable ramp (including searching the library), very nice
1 Gaea's Touch #play one additional forest a turn. I've got a lot of forests in here
1 Harrow #best after titania and omnath are out. Sacrifice "elemetified" land for additional omnath elemental death trigger

1 Skyshroud Claim #searches duals, enter play untapped!
1 Skyshroud Ranger #play more than one land a turn

1 Traverse the Outlands #should be at least 5, might be a lot more
1 Yavimaya Elder #possible cut? 3 Mana, search only basics, only into hand, too expensive for early ramp? Otoh, blocker you won't miss if he dies

card draw

1 Garruk's Packleader #with omnath: play a land, draw a card

1 Rishkar's Expertise #expected card draw: at least five. with undergrowth champion, baloth after multiple landfalls, hydra, rubblehulk maybe many more
1 Seer's Sundial #landfall - 2 mana to draw card. we should play a lot of land, hopefully we have a lot of mana to spare for card draw
1 Shamanic Revelation #all omnath (and titania) tokens have power 5, with a lot of tokens that are a lot of cards (and life)
1 Tireless Tracker #similar to seer's sundial, but cards can be  drawn anytime

lands matter
1 Baloth Woodcrasher #Gigantic with big ramp spells
1 Centaur Vinecrasher #we do routinely send lands to the graveyard, so he can be quite big when he enters. Builtin recursion

1 Stalking Vengeance #so you sacrifice a 5/5 (or 5/3) elemental creature? How about you do an additional 5 damage to a player in addition to the 3 damage from omnath?
1 Warstorm Surge #So you sacrificed three lands (elemental creatures) and then returned six lands from the graveyard and created 3 5/3 titania and 6 5/5 omnath token? how about each of those does 5 damage to a creature or a player?
1 Where Ancients Tread #see above (only can't be doubled by gratuitous violence)
